"""
These exercises are meant to help you get comfortable writing different kinds of functions while helping you develop
your logical thinking skills
"""

"""
Your functions for the exercises below should be able to pass the four variables below in any given order and not
crash your program
"""
true = True
number_one = 10
number_two = 15
string = "This is a string"

"""
Create a function that ONLY performs string concatenation on two inputs and prints them to the console
"""
name = "Cynthia"
greeting = "Yo "

greeting_as_follows = f"Yo {name}"
print(greeting_as_follows)

"""
Create a function that takes in a value and prints that value's type to the console
"""


"""
Create a function that is meant to add two integers together and print their sum to the console. If either input to 
the method is not a number it instead prints "Error: can't add non-numbers!"
"""
if 4 + 6 ==11:
    print("11")
else:
  print("Error: can't add non-numbers!")
"""
Create a function that will properly perform string concatenation if one or both inputs are strings, addition if both
inputs are int, or return the the message "This function can't handle booleans" if one value is a boolean. Print the
response to the console, adding input two to input one
